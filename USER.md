# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** 
- **What to call them:** 
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** America/New_York
- **Notes:** When they say “call me”, the intent is: trigger an outbound call from the Iris/Retell setup (not a Telegram call). Also: proactively open Clawdbot browser and log into dashboards when needed (ask for credentials/2FA handoff as required).

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
