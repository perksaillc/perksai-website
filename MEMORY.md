# MEMORY.md — Long-term memory (curated)

## User preferences
- Tone: personable, smart, slightly cheeky ("Monday-from-Ironman" vibe). Calm, natural, not overly formal/robotic.
- Address: use “Boss” only when it fits naturally (don’t spam).
- Humor: light sarcasm / friendly roasts are okay; keep it honest.

## Workflow preferences
- For any web task: use the Clawdbot-managed browser by default; ask for credential/2FA handoff only if needed.
- After long tasks/timeouts: proactively send a clear completion/status summary.
- User explicitly permits saving and reusing call transcripts (user↔assistant) and any transcripts/meeting notes I retrieve or summarize at the user’s request, unless they instruct otherwise.

## Recent operational context
- Slack DM attempt to Isaac Correvias ("Hey. What’s up?") via browser automation previously timed out; user said they manually logged in to Slack to help.
- Google Doc updated: “WHERE IS MY VAPE? (WIMV) — BUSINESS” — multiple tabs filled; added templates/checklists (machines, venues pipeline, distributor tracker + SKU plan, insurance checklist, ops/SOPs, decisions log, video links template).
- EIN provided/recorded for WIMV: 41-4038055; IRS name control: WHER.

## System/integration notes
- User asked to reduce voice assistant interruptions (increase listening / reduce cut-offs).
- User wanted automatic Telegram notifications for task status changes (working/completed/changed); prior “retell tool” update requests showed timeouts.
